# Poke Timer
This web app is a productivity timer. After you finish a timed session you receive a pokemon as a reward. You can set the timer between 5 and 60 minutes. You can either receive a new pokemon by clicking on the egg in the pokedex, or click a pokemon in the pokedex you've previously collected to evolve it.
