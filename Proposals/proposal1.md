A timer/game web app, similar to the pomodoro technique. When a user completes a timer they receive a pokemon as a reward, the goal is to collect all pokemon by being productive.

Users of this site will be anyone that needs to work or study and wants a way to motivate themselves into being productive for a set amount of time. 

I would be using HTML, CCS, JS and Pokemon API.
